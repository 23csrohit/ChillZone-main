## About The Project ‚≠ê
<p>‚ÄúSometimes the most productive thing you can do is relax‚Äù ~ Mark Black

Stress has become a part of everyone's life. We are always stressed about something or the other. We do not care about resting and relaxing for a bit. Even when we get free time, we are either found skimming through memes on facebook or scrolling reels on Instagram. We have therefore developed ChillZone- a place for you to relax and spend some time. What's special about ChillZone? We have a collection of interesting games, soothing music and rib tickling jokes to add that bit of fun to your boring life.</p>

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap

## Future Prospects
- New games in the Let's Play section
- Add more fun ways to relax üòâüòâ<br/>
<p>It's all upto your creativity. Feel free to create issues and contribute to this repository.</p>
